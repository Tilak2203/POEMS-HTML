            Everytime I feel like m drowning. 🌀
            When you being with false fellowship.👥
            I felt the every word you said. 🈚
            Which doesn't go out of my head. 🙆‍♂️

            Overwhelmed by the talks we had. 🗣️
            Submerged by the moments of glad. ⌛
            Being with company through the night.🌌
            Nothing left, leaving the ignite. 🔥

            Burned with the sorrows and threats. ♨️
            Drenched by the guilt of sweats. 🌧️
            Shrivelled by the rays of fear. 🏜️
            Pierced by the needle of artificial behavior. 🎭

            No worries! Everything repeats annually.
            Making you stronger itself and manually.
            Ruin your inside peace and slaughter.👽
            Reminding of BEING UNDERWATER.🤢
