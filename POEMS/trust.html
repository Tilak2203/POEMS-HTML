            Just as many things in relational cube.📦
            Trust is one of the part of that group.🍰
            Even though if you fall free on someone.🤗
            There's always one person who will overcome.😁

            You realised me as leftover pickle in plate. 🍽️
            But I was the diamond of treasures crate.💎
            Still there's not a single bit of hate.🤬
            Words are less and million things to relate🤔 

            I wish you would never leave my hand.🤝
            But I was holding the sack of sand.💰
            This was the illusion created by my mind.🙁
            Gon so deep and now unable to resign🙉

            A hug is the symbol for love.🤗
            Taste is the symbol for dishes.😛
            No matter, in future if he ditches 😣
            "BROKEN TRUST" is what it teaches 💯
