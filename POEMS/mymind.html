            I don't know my mind. 😔
            But my mind knows I can shine. 😉
            But still there's some unconsciousness .😟
            Which makes me to get in deep fantasy,
            which either be my friend of mine. 😁

            I think there's some sort of depression.😞
            But still everything going well in sarcasm.✌️
            M still DEEPLY Searching why people just USE AND THROW.😳
            But m still choosing to not show up my ATTITUDE AND EGO.😣
          
            I know they might be better than me.🙁
            But still m hoping to see.😒
            Then too m not able to resign. 😶
            I don't  know my Mind. 💔
            I don't know my Mind. 😅
