            This story is all about the past.
            When I was small and everythin was vast.
            My eyes suddenly got blocked at someone.
            My heart saying, " let's become One".
            
            Those 15 minutes of staring each other.
            Felt like something beyond this universe.
            Thinking of only you and me in surroundin
            Like the way as two love birds.
            
            Going from home to school and School to home.
            Holding the pinky fingers and cherishing alone.
            Then saying Good byes everyday.
            Becoming very curious of meeting next day.
            
            Years passed by within section of second.
            Then becoming busy in schedule which never end.
            However, unable to hold the love again.
            Saying final Good bye feeling the shame.
