      <h4 class="intro">
        Hello ! My name is Tilak and I am 19 yrs old. I was born and brought up
        in city called Mumbai, India. Talking about my educational background, I
        have done my schooling from Thakur Vidya Mandir High School (2018),
        Kandivali, Mumbai. I have completed Diploma in Digital Electronics from
        Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic (2018-21), Ville Parle, Mumbai. And
        currently persuing undergraduate course in Electronics and
        Telecommunication from St. Francis Institute Of Technology (2021-24),
        Borivali, Mumbai. My crave for listening to songs is always at its peak
        tbh. Apart from listening songs my some part of life also falls into the
        Musical Era. Being a musician I am a Guitarist and I have also
        recomposed about 15 songs. Reality by Lost Frequencies is one of my most
        loved composition. I am also a poet (sometimes), being an author for
        about 10 poems. Since childhood my most of the hobbies mainly lie into
        the Technical field and one of them is Web developement. Living in an
        superstitious society I am kindoff religious person who loves visiting
        temple every weekend and participating in the religious practices which
        works for the welfare of the society. So thats all from my side. Thank
        You : )
