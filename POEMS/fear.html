            Previously I was happy with Everything😇
            Living my WORLD like a KING 👑
            Only Happiness with no other FEELING 🤩
            But now it feels like something is Burning🙁
            
            There was no fear before😁
            There used to be many things to restore🤨
            Suddenly, I explored something severe😓
            BEING ALONE is my Greatest FEAR.🤯
            
            This fear made me act like Enemy😑
            Depression, Anger and with lots of other army😓
            Started staying away from the GROUPS😟
            With no other eternity and hopes.☹️
            
            I tried drowning my pain 😔
            But my pain learned to Swim again 🤨
            I can't just stay without knowing me own🧐
            That my greatest fear is BEING ALONE.🤫
